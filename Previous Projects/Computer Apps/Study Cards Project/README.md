# Study Card Project
Developing Images and Collisions for Device Deployment

Purpose: continue "Owning Data" issue in apps
*Reminder*: Computer Science 10 "Owning Data" is the Music Player

Progression:
1. Case Study
2. Screen Size Checker (algorithm similar to auto sizing an image)
3. Auto sizing an image (similar to auto sizing text)


**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Case Study: What do you want to test yourself with today? (Boolean Choice)
- Details to work out
  - Vocabulary word
  - Main information
  - Minor information
  - Images
  - Where in the notes this is referenced
  - What projects reference this information
-

GUI Case Study (to pseudocode), layout
- 3 large DIVs for ... ( rect() )
  - Content Presentation: Title, Image, Vocabulary Words, Legend for ID
  - Moveable Tokens to match image: feedback given when correct token on the image (perhaps into the actual legend)
  - Instructions: highlight or changed for contrast (attention getting)
  - Additional Item: Scoreboard (competitive or non-competitive) illustrating progress
  - Additional Item: instructions must have “move one toke to it” and feedback that the legend works
  - Additional Item: Name, Grade, Class Fields for Student or Teacher Tracking of Ownership
- Title
- Image
- Legend with tokens
- Vocabulary words with option to create more by the student

Example Documents to Generate Ideas
- Main Teaching DOCs
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Yd8XR5aKQUG7L7M-DQcnghtrFo2LgEx1OWf-6dRRKuA/edit?usp=sharing">Original Version Copy of Water Cycle</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Uvtav-rZmgEob3AmjpMirZu7pgn0QCt48f9wpQfiz1s/edit?usp=sharing">Mercer's Kitchen Copy of Water Cycle</a>
Case Study Example Advanced Coding Features
- Ability to add and change information or data base

Coding Concepts: Mercer's Kitchen will help with all of these
- GUI Layout with rect(), ratios
- Visual Design: colour contrast, layering, readability
- GUI “Game” Layout
  - Especially knowing where the correct answer is,
- Variables & Casting
- 2D Shapes and Layering
- Text and auto-sizing
- Quit Button
- Images and sizing with landscape, portrait, or square into existing rectangle
  - [Intermediate] Array memory structure for aspect ration
- Color: background, text, image-tint (filter), shapes
- [Intermediate] Array Memory Structure
- [Intermediate] Saving Preferences and Game
  - .txt writing & reading
  - “End of Game” .txt scripts
  - “As Game Progresses” .txt scripts

  - New Vocabulary words saved
  - Legend Correctness and tokens moved to correct spots when correct
  - Personal Identifiers like name, etc.
- Decisions
  - IF
  - IF-ELSE
  - IF-ELSEIF-ELSE
  - Case Statements
- Iterations
  - Void Draw () {}
  - FOR Loop
  - Keyboard Input
  - Mouse Input
- Calculator Concepts for Scoreboard:
  - Central Tendency
  - Range
  - Progress: how many solved, how many to go
  - [Intermediate] Coding type of vocabulary word (for example, can user understand concrete concepts or abstract concepts)

# Ideas to Include
Teacher Only Files, <a href="https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Cue-Cards">Click Here</a>

Main Features (need to be coded before incorporating)
- Computer app export, starting as .pde
- JS with special print command for browser app or paper version

Overview of owning-data
- Host the data base on Google Sheets
- Host the PHP a RPi on the Classroom
- Processing-JAVA to act as a Android Side Load or Computer App
- Ability to scale to Android Studio
- Google Scripting to download regular and local copies of data-based,
- then uploading and comparing data bases to check if entries are reasonable
- Developing a protocol to delete very old database copies

Screen Size Checker
- Case Study this
- Answer: will the coded canvas fit on this monitor
- Answer: with the ratios work on this geometry
- Vocabulary:
  - size(), width and height
  - fullScreen(), displayWidth & displayHeight
  - Landscape, Portrait, and Square (remembers assignment from Websites)
- See Coded Examples in Prototyping for Screen Size Checker 

Collisions of Circles into rectangle-IF

Include two types of File IO in Processing ... making memories for a program
- Program exit() memory
- Program progression memory
- New Type of Reset Button, reset the memories of a computer

Items to add
- Clock

Coding Consideration
1. Arrays
   - When an array is used to store data, the array index range is stored in the first dimension of the number used
   - null is entered when nothing exists
   - zero is entered when information exists in other dimensions
2. GUI: layout nested FORs to count starting pieces and rectangles
   - Should see original numbers before practicing nested for loops and arithmetic
